what is this:

based on Logo
<canvas> on the top
refactored console like demo.js on the bottom
some built in functions to manipulate the turtle:
    go(dist)
    turn(deg)
    color/colour(str)
    width(num)
    pen_up()
    pen_down()
    invisible()
    visible()
    reset()

then, simple drawing, use loops, def, etc.
save everything since last reset under a name (just save src)

can the functions be written in python? how do we access the dom/canvas?
