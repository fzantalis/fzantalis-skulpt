<h2>Python. Client side.</h2>

<p>Skulpt is an <em>entirely in-browser</em> implementation of Python.</p>

<p>No preprocessing, plugins, or server-side support required, just write
Python and push <code>F5</code>.</p>

<h2>Demo</h2>

<div id="terminal"><span id="isk"></span></div>

<p>You can

<a href="#" id="codeexample1">slap</a>
<a href="#" id="codeexample2">some</a>
<a href="#" id="codeexample3">code</a>

in there to play around.</p>

<p>It's running entirely in your browser, so don't feel obligated to try to
&quot;crash the server&quot;; you'll only stub your toe.</p>

<p>That's just for demoing up there. Normally of course, you'd stick your code
in regular ol' <code>.py</code> files and use <code>import</code> to
XmlHttpRequest them from a server.</p>

<h2>Your Very Own Copy</h2>

<p>Want to give it a shot? Grab it with a:</p>
<pre>
    hg clone <a href="http://bitbucket.org/sgraham/skulpt/">http://bitbucket.org/sgraham/skulpt/</a>
</pre>

<p>Skulpt surely isn't done yet.</p>

<p>I'd call it something like 0.12 alpha if it had a version, but versions
are just SHA1's these days.</p>

<p>It's peeking out into the world now, as it's fun to play with already. If
you decide to peek back, first imagine a fearsomely comprehensive disclaimer
of liability. Then fear, comprehensively<sup><a
        href="http://www.cliki.net/">&dagger;</a></sup>.

<p>The entire Python test suite does not run correctly yet, but that is the
long term goal, insofar as it makes sense.</p>

<p>If you'd like to chit-chat, <a href="http://groups.google.com/group/skulpt">there's a list for
    that</a>.</p>

<h2>Pleasant</h2>

<p><em>SkulptR</em> is the next part of the plan.</p>

<p>What plan is that?</p>

<p>The one where I employ increasingly strained wordplay to fit a
predetermined naming convention?</p>

<p>No, I'd like it to be a <span class="under">R</span>ich app GUI framework that I enjoy using.</p>

<pre>
def main():
    v = Panel()
    v.add(Button())
    print "fun and easy!"
</pre>

<p>For a while though, the plan will just be implementing the language.
Perhaps others will write some delightful code in the meanwhile.</p>

    Yes, I know how &quot;sculpt&quot; is spelled. The correct spelling was
